Option 1:
To handle the spikes in the requests we can cache the update requests during the surge hours and actually update the DB during the day

Pros:
it will prevent the slowdowns

Cons:
the mystats option won't tell the actual stats during those hours

Option 2:
Seperate the DB to few DB's according to age groups (0-20,20-30,30-50,50-Inf) or cities (depends on the traffic from each city)
then the burden of handling all the update requests will be divided

Pros:
the stats are always correct

Cons:
you will need to maintain more databases and a load balancer
